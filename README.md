This is a project I have done in my 12th grade(2020) for online bus ticket reservation using python.This project is not the optimised method.
I did it as a part of school credit to learn about the python libraries,feature and explore them.
This project uses tkinter and connected to mysql to access the database to book tickets.I also did the UI to be as real as possible by using the feature to breate background,buttons,text font and colour.
I consider this project as my first learning experience in the world of python.
